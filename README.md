Instructions:

Enter a term into the search box. As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear below. If you are not sure of a term to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

The theme is Sitcoms to inspire you to enter a Sitcom term, but feel free to search any items that is of interest to you.
